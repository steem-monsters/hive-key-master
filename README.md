# hive-key-master

## Explanation

This script makes it easy to manage authorities (keys, accounts) and set the threshold (how many authorities are needed to broadcast a transaction) of your Hive account. Use-case could be that you want to share access to your Hive account and thus Splinterlands game with other people (i.e. guild members), but need a way to revoke access, without having to change your primary key.
